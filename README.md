Project : Project3QUESTIONS
All information was sourced in ASU Class training for Cybersecurity Bootcamp Class of 2025. The information breakdon on CIM Add-on was specifically issued by ChatGPT 4.0. All remaining information bases have been pulled from class notes, project work time and ChatGPT 4.0 for additional sourced information. Plagiarism is a serious crime.

 # Cybersecurity ReadMe: ASU Graduate Study Path  
*Focused on Security+ & Network+ Preparation*
 ##Objective
 Document the tools, methodologies, and learning 
resources used to prepare for the CompTIA 
**Security+** and **Network+** certifications, with 
emphasis on practical threat hunting and Windows 
internals.
 ##Study Methodologies
 ###TaHiTI (Targeted Hunting and Threat 
Intelligence)- Structured approach to threat hunting using 
intelligence to guide investigative paths.- Focus on high-value assets and suspected threat 
actor TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures).
 ###DUTCH Methodology- **D**etect **U**nderstand **T**riage **C**onfirm 
**H**arden- A systematic way to break down, validate, and 
respond to security incidents with respect to AML 
and banking.
 ###PEAK Threat Hunting Framework (By Sqrrl, now 
AWS)- Hunt hypothesis development- Use of analytic techniques- Iterative feedback and learning- [PEAK Hunting PDF 
Guide](https://sqrrl-public.s3.amazonaws.com/PEA
 K-Threat-Hunting-Model.pdf)
 ##Concepts Covered- **Windows Registry Forensics** via 
`Autoruns.exe` and registry keys- **Persistence Mechanisms** detection- **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)** vs 
**Indicators of 
Attack (IOAs)**- **Command Line Tools** for Windows Incident 
Response- **Networking Fundamentals**: ports, 
protocols, OSI/TCP-IP models- **Cryptography & Authentication Protocols**: 
SSL/TLS, hashing, PKI
 ##Key Learning Resources
 ### Official Sites & Documentation
 Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/e
 n-us/windows/win32/sysinfo/registry)- [Sysinternals Suite 
(Autoruns)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/
 sysinternals/downloads/autoruns)
 ###Tools Explored- `Autoruns.exe` and `Autorunsc.exe`- `netstat`, `ipconfig`, `tracert`, `nslookup`, 
`PowerShell`- `Wireshark` for network packet analysis- CompTIA Security+ (SY0-601) Official Study 
Guide  - CompTIA Network+ (N10-008) Study Guide- Used **ChatGPT** (OpenAI) for:
  - Clarifying complex concepts  
  - Drafting summaries and demos  
  - Creating structured study plans  
  - Generating realistic threat scenarios
 ## Summary
 This document is a self-paced, hybrid learning map 
combining practical skills, certification prep, and 
hands-on tooling. Leveraging both vendor 
documentation and threat hunting frameworks 
ensures readiness not just for exams, but also for 
real-world cybersecurity roles.
